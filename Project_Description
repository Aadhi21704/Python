# PASCAL's TRIANGLE_Description

The number of rows are gotten as input from the user.
The 'math' library is imported in this project.
The function 'factorial' is used in order to follow the formula.
FORMULA : nCr = n!/((n-r)!*r!)
Since we can't use the '!' character as used in the formula,
we can make use of the function 'factorial' and proceed further.
We're substituting 'n' with 'i', and 'r' with 'j'.
